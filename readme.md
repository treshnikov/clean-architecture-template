# CQRS demo
The demo project demonstrates a template that can be used for developing a backend for medium and large projects. The approach includes the usage of MediatR, and FluentValidation libraries to build and handle a request pipeline. According to such segregation, new business logic can be added easily in terms of domain models, validation rules, commands, and queries.

## Possible improvements
